# Introduction
Welcome to TechScape. In the beginning of 2020, five Portuguese entrepreneurs built
a startup to sell goods related to digital detox. Using an online store, TechScape sells
products and services which will allow their customers to stay focused on the most
important things and improve the balance with technology use in their lives, such as
meditation kits, books, stress balls, ”dumb” phones, retreats, among others.
With the emergence of Covid-19 in March 2020, the company had some financial
difficulties, and they were out of function in April 2020. But in May 2020, they
restarted their activities, knowing that a digital detox is becoming even more critical
in this period of time, where people need to unplug themselves and improve their
quality of life.
Focused in increasing their sales, TechScape hired a team of data scientists to
analyze the online behavior of their customers and to predict which customers have
a high probability of buying their products depending on their online actions.
# Objective of the project
Your goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question “Which customers
are more likely to buy our products?” using the small quantity of data accessible
from the customers data base that contains general information about the customers
and their behaviour in the website from February 2020 till December 2020 (excluding
April).
# Datasets
You have access to two different datasets:
1. The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. In this
set, you also have the ground truth associated with each user access, i.e., if the
user buy at least one product (1) or not (0).
2. The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen
data. In this set you don’t have access to the ground truth, and the goal of
your team is to predict that value (“0” or “1”) by using the model you created
using the training set.
